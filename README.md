To run this project you need to create a .env with the following variables, REACT_APP_BACK_END: Where you should put your backend url,
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ID: To be able to login with google you should create a credentials in google OAuth 2.0,
REACT_APP_MAPBOX: The last but not least important, token of the map, you can obtain it in the official page of mapbox, is easy to create.

Besides the .env you need the backend that is listed in my repositories or access through this link https://github.com/luis9laguna/TravelMap-BackEnd.

Thanks for checking my project, is a really simple project but really good to learn and practice some basic skills in react.
